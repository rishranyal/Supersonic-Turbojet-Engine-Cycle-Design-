# Supersonic-Turbojet-Engine-Cycle-Design-
A fully functional platform to get the desired parameters for a supersonic turbojet engine cruising at a given Mach number at some altitude.

 This work focuses on the design and analysis of turbojet cycles for supersonic aircraft. We have taken a
 case study of SP-71 operating at a cruising Mach number of 3.2 at an altitude of 80,000 ft. The primary
 objective is to design an efficient intake diffuser that decelerates supersonic airflow to subsonic speeds
 before reaching the compressor, ensuring stable operation and acquiring the required thrust. The study
 involves modelling thermodynamic properties, analysing shock wave behaviour, optimising pressure
 recovery to meet the demands of high-speed flight, and obtaining the required thrust and exit Mach
 number.The approach undertaken in this study is primarily theoretical and computational, focusing on the
 aerodynamic and thermodynamic modelling of a supersonic turbojet intake diffuser.

  Assumptions
 ● Steady-State Flow: The flow through the intake is assumed to be steady and one-dimensional.
 ● Ideal Gas: Air is treated as a perfect gas with constant properties for simplicity.
 ● Isentropic Flow: The flow between shocks is considered isentropic, neglecting friction and heat
 transfer.
 ● NoStructural Interactions: Effects of structural deformation or vibration on the airflow are not
 considered

 This methodology provides a structured approach to addressing the aerodynamic challenges in
 supersonic intake design, ensuring the results are robust and applicable to real-world scenarios.
